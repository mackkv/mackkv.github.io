Abstract: An Android app has been developed to assist in the education of individuals in a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) course of study. The Android Reflection Application provides students a means to determine distances to objects while allowing them the ability to manipulate signal envelopes, signal shapes, signal types, and frequency constraints. The convenient and intuitive graphical user interface immerses the user into a richly educational environment allowing for the solidification of fundamental concepts regarding digital signal processing (DSP). In addition to the educational benefits, this application is also being applied to spatial acoustic analysis and assistance in low-visibility. This feature will allow users to determine the best use for a given space whether it is a quiet study room or a room better suited for conference meetings. The effectiveness of this application has not yet been formally tested but suggests a positive result.
