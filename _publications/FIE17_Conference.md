Abstract: This paper describes the use of Bluetooth hardware for localization and signal processing education on Android smart-phones and tablets. The localization algorithm uses the Received Signal Strength Indcation (RSSI) value of transmitting devices in order to triangulate their position. The concepts that are featured in the use of this technology have classroom relevant content such as multilateration (a matrix problem in linear algebra), wave properties and interactions (physics), statistics relating to laboratory data, and engineering application concepts (such as software development and coding). These concepts can be taught through classroom demonstrations and interaction. Preliminary data from in-class activities demonstrate the effectiveness of the app for teaching concepts in localization and ranging. Further in-class activities and workshops are planned.
