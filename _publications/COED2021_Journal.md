Abstract: An Android application that realizes an audible version of echolocation has been implemented. Bundled within the app are videos, notes, problems, and discussion questions, thus creating an “eModule”. The eModule contains material that is relevant to several educational levels including K-12 and undergraduate engineering. By using the echolocation features of the app, at the K-12 level, teachers are able to introduce labs, and science and engineering practices into their lesson plans. By using data collection and interpretation, undergraduate students can be exposed to various concepts in signals and systems, digital signal processing, and machine learning. Assessment instruments for the evaluation of the Reflections app, as well as the bundled content, have been developed. Pre/post assessment data and results of survey instruments have been collected and analyzed in an effort to assess the impact of the tool on student learning at the undergraduate level, as well as impacts on K-12 teacher interest in introducing science and engineering practices in their lesson plans.
