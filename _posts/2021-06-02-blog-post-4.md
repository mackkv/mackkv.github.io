This blog post will be an old homework assignment from the Data Analysis of Complex Systems course. The assignment focuses on modeling the dynamics of a perturbed beam. In this work, we not only generate a working simulation of the perturbed beam problem using MATLAB's ordinary differential equation (ode) solvers , we also apply equation-free modeling. Details are given in [ee520-hw5.pdf](http://mackkv.github.io/files/ee520-hw5.pdf).
