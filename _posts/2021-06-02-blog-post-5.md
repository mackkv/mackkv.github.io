This post focuses on using an appropriate basis to decompose certain types of data (images and audio) as a preprocessing step to feature learning and classification. We select a reasonable basis based on prior knowledge of images and audio data and intuition, then transform the original datasets into this new space. After multiplying each data sample by the chosen basis, we attempt to find the features of the transformed dataset that are "most useful" for cluster analysis (in this case, linear discriminant analysis (LDA)). The basis selection is done to facilitate dimensionality reduction in the decomposed space. In this way, a single image or audio sample can be represented as a point in $N$-dimensional space, with the $N$ modes corresponding to the features with the most energy.  
Details are given in [ee520-hw3-A](http://mackkv.github.io/files/EE520_HW3_Q1Q3Q4.pdf).  
The answer to problem 2 is given separately, [here](http://mackkv.github.io/files/EE520_HW3_Q2.pdf).
