Graduate Course Load (Clarkson University)
======
* Digital Signal Processing (EE401/501)  
Course Description: An introduction to discrete-time signal processing. Topics include: A
review of orthogonality, Fourier series, Fourier transforms and
sampling theory. Smoothing, interpolation, D/A conversion. Digital
filters, windows. Design of nonrecursive filters, recursive filters.
Correlation and spectra of random signals, spectral estimation.

* Electronic Device IC Sim (EE441/541)  
Course Description:Study of modern electronic devices, p-n junctions, bipolor junction
transistors (BJTs) and metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect
transistors (MOSFETs), for integrated circuit applications. SPICE
device models are introduced, and several SPICE simulation projects
are given for integrated circuit design and analysis. This course
provides a foundation for understanding SPICE device models and
the basics of the microelectronic technology.

* Coding and Information Transmission (EE470/570)  
Course Description: Error detecting and error correcting codes. Encoding of signals and
data compression. Huffman codes. Concepts of information. Limits
on attainable data compression. Limits on data rates for reliable or
errorless transmission.

* Computer Vision (CS652)  
Course Description: This course will cover both classical and
recent progress in the field of computer vision, both on the theory
and practice. Material covered will be from both the textbook and
relevant research papers in the area. After taking this course,
students will achieve the necessary knowledge to solve various
practical computer-vision problems and build a solid background for
further computer-vision research. Topics covered include: Early
vision on one and multiple images (linear filters, edge detection,
stereopsis), mid-level vision (segmentation, object tracking), highlevel vision (model-based vision, graph-based image segmentation)
and applications (medical image analysis, image-based rendering).

* Stochastic Processes in Engineering (EE529)  
Course Description:

* Pattern Recognition and Neural Networks (EE574)  
Course Description: Bayes decision theory, discriminant functions and decision surfaces.
Supervised learning, parametric methods, Parzan windows, nearest
neighbor classification, Fisher's linear discriminant. Unsupervised
learning and clustering. Neural networks, single-layer perceptron
convergence algorithm, gradient descent training, generalizations to
multilayer feed-forward networks. Classifier complexity and sample
size. Hopfield networks for autoassociative memory, unsupervised
and self-organizing networks.

* Adaptive Signal Processing (EE628)  
Course Description:An introduction to adaptive signal processing. Topics include;
Applications of adaptive systems, adaptive linear combiner, Wiener
least-squares solution, gradient search, the LMS/RLS algorithms,
block time/frequency domain LMS, system identification.

* Data Analysis of Complex Systems (EE520)  
Course Descriptions: The goal of this course will be an integration of concepts of complex
systems with big data analysis. Methodology will be drawn from
statistical and Bayesian analysis, time-frequency analysis, image
processing, linear algebra and principal component analysis,
machine learning and image recognition, dimensionality reduction
for dynamical systems, system identification, data assimilation,
compressed sensing, and equation free modeling. Applications may
include PDEs such as advection diffusion from atmospheric data and
also steady flow, networked and social data-sets, feature
identification in neurological applications, music analysis and
identification, and image denoising. 

* Detection and Estimation Theory (EE528)  
Course Description: Combines the classical techniques of statistical inference and the
random process characterization of communication, radar, and
other modern data processing systems. 

* Bayesian Data Analysis (STAT585)  
Course Description: This course will introduce both the principles and practice of
Bayesian methods for data analysis. This is a hands-on course that
will use MATLAB software. Students will learn to write their own
Bayesian computer programs to solve problems relevant to
engineering, biology, chemistry, physics, earth science, ecology,
economics, signal processing and machine learning. Topics that will
be included are parameter estimation, model selection, time series
and error analysis. 

* Neuromorphic Computing (EE701)  
Course Description:

* Deep Learning (CS570)  
Course Description: This course will cover the principles of modern deep learning architectures from a theoretical and practical perspective.  Course topics covered will include an introduction to machine learning and basic neural network architectures, and in-depth discussions on convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks based on units such as LSTMs and GRUs, and, if time permits, GANs.  Students will be required to implement programming assignments and projects that apply deep learning architectures to solve classification and regression problems.  Students will read and assess papers on current evolutions to these architectures. Graduate students will do additional work.
